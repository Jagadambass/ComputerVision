# ComputerVision
 * We will be using Python since it is one of the most popular programming languages. And it  has opened numerous job opportunities in various sectors. 
 * We will start from the  installation process right up to creating exciting projects such as detecting colors , shapes humans and even vehicle number plates. 
 * So If you are a beginner  don't worry this course is for you. We will skip all the boring theory stuff and focus on the practical implementation. 
 * So you can get the computer vision skill set you have always wanted in your CV.
 * By the end of the course you will become familiar with the core principle of opencv and apply different techniques to solve real world problems using computer vision. 
 *  pip install cv2
